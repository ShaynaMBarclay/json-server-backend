      "description": "This is Green the cat. 7 years of temporary homes. It so happened that he is theoretically left without a guardian. He lived in temporary housing, and not just one, but no one was taking care of finding him a permanent home. So he lived like an invisible being, as if he was there, but at the same time not. Green holds his head slightly to the side. A long time ago, he was treated for ear problems, but this trait has remained with him. What's the situation now - it's unknown. It needs to be checked. Green is like a shadow - he quietly sits always in one place and stares at one spot. I really want a kind and sincere person to notice this cat. He has already suffered enough, and the conditions he lived in were not always good. He has never known what human care and love are. Please pay attention to Green.",

Sad, because she lives in a shelter in a separate and constantly closed room. Sandra cannot live with her fellow cats. She is proud and must be the only one in the family. With people, she is very affectionate and sociable. An adult, balanced cat who won't cause mess, noise, or torn curtains in your house. There will be peace, and in it, the quiet soothing purr of your fluffy friend. We are looking to give her to responsible adults who can take care of the animal. Feed her good food, treat her if necessary, and most importantly, take her with you if you have to move.",

But this call broke my resolve and promises to myself. A man called, who himself couldn't pass by and picked up a kitten in terrible condition from the street. He treated it for two weeks at his own expense. However, the treatment hit a dead end, and the kitten wasn't getting better. The man started seeking help and advice. He listed all the shelters and even named volunteers to whom he had reached out. I was the last on his list. After watching the video and listening to the man, I agreed... Yes, I have quite a few debts today, and those under my care are also receiving treatment. But I really wanted to help this man achieve the happy outcome he had started and so desired. His sincerity, kindness, and tenderness towards the little unfortunate creature won me over... What we have today ‚Äì out of two sick eyes, one has been removed. However, both the removed eye and the one that remains look bad ‚Äì purulent discharge, untreated infection. The broken leg won't 'repair,' the nerve is torn, and hopefully, amputation can be avoided. The little girl is weak, with leukocytosis and anemia. üêæ LATEST UPDATEüêæ She is still living in a cage at the clinic, unfortunately, there are no people interested in adopting her so far... They are treating one eye, but there are no other procedures. We are waiting for a miracle and a person with a big sincere heart.",
